# VelocityAuction – Live Bike Auction Platform

VelocityAuction is a full-stack web application that enables users to participate in live motorcycle auctions in real time. Users can browse available bikes, place bids, track ongoing auctions, and view auction results. Administrators can create and manage auctions, upload bike images, and monitor platform activity through a dedicated dashboard.

The project is built using the MERN stack with TypeScript and Socket.IO to provide a seamless real-time bidding experience.
